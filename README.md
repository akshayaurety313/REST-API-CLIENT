# 🌐 REST API Client

## 📌 Introduction

A **REST API Client** is a software application designed to interact with **RESTful web services**. It enables sending HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to a server and receiving structured responses, typically in **JSON or XML format**. REST API clients are widely used in modern software systems to integrate external services, retrieve data, or perform operations over the web.

This project demonstrates how a REST API Client can be implemented using programming languages such as **Java, Python, or JavaScript**. It helps developers understand **API consumption, HTTP protocols, data parsing, and client-server communication.**

## 🛠️ Editor Tools Used

Depending on the programming language chosen, you can use:

* **Java:** IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans
* **Python:** VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, IDLE
* **JavaScript/Node.js:** Visual Studio Code, WebStorm
* **Postman / Insomnia:** For testing and simulating API requests before coding

---

## 💻 Platforms

* **Operating Systems:** Windows, Linux, macOS
* **Programming Environments:**

  * Java (JDK + Maven/Gradle)
  * Python (pip + requests/httpx libraries)
  * Node.js (Axios, Fetch API, SuperAgent)

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used

* **HTTP Libraries:**

  * Java: `HttpURLConnection`, `HttpClient`, `OkHttp`
  * Python: `requests`, `http.client`
  * JavaScript: `Axios`, `Fetch API`
* **Data Handling:**

  * JSON Parsers (`org.json`, `Gson`, `Jackson`, `json` in Python)
* **API Testing:** Postman, Curl
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

 🌍 Applications

A REST API Client has applications in many domains:

1. **Data Retrieval & Integration** – Fetching weather data, stock prices, or news from APIs.
2. **Web & Mobile Applications** – Backend integration for apps like e-commerce, banking, or social media.
3. **Automation** – Interacting with cloud services, CI/CD tools, or monitoring systems.
4. **Third-Party Service Integration** – Connecting with payment gateways (PayPal, Stripe), messaging services (Twilio, Slack), or mapping (Google Maps API).
5. **Microservices Architecture** – Communication between different services using REST APIs.
6. **IoT Systems** – Devices sending data to cloud servers via RESTful services.
